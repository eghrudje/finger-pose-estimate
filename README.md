# Finger Pose Tracking Using Kalman Filtering

This project applies a Kalman filtering approach to enhance the accuracy of accelerometry-based finger pose tracking, specifically targeting applications in rehabilitation. The system uses MPU6050 sensors placed on a hand orthosis to capture joint angles in real-time. Through adaptive filtering, this project minimizes noise and improves data reliability, making it particularly useful for dynamic rehabilitation environments.
